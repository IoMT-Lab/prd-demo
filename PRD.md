# PRD for Scenario photo_detector_tests.txt 2025-08-30T07:13:24.631Z

## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
This program uses a photo detector over I²C. The driver handles register reads and writes and provides functions for turning the LED on and off. Unit tests are being developed to confirm that all the critical parts of the system behave correctly, including the initialization sequence, which involves bringing up the I²C interface, passing control to the driver, powering on the device, reading three IDs (auxiliary ID, revision ID, and base ID), and enabling LED control functions only after ID verification.

### Objectives
1. Ensure the reliability of the photo detector's functionality through comprehensive unit testing, including both polling and interrupt modes.
2. Validate correct operation of the LED control functionality.
3. Identify and rectify any issues in data communication over I²C.
4. Confirm correct initialization and bring-up sequence for the device and driver.

## Product Overview

### Features
- Photo detector communication over I²C.
- LED control with on and off functions.
- Register read and write capabilities.
- Two measurement modes: polling and interrupts.
  - **Polling Mode**: Enable measurements, read every five seconds, pulse the LED on for about half a second, and ensure interrupt registers stay unset. Proves mode ignores interrupts even if thresholds should fire.
  - **Interrupt Mode**: Configure high and low threshold registers, enable interrupt capabilities, check for triggers every second, and incorporate negative tests to confirm no interrupts trigger with impossible threshold values. Confirms interrupts occur if thresholds should always trip.
- Order of operations: IDs must be read before enabling the LED, and thresholds must be set before enabling interrupts.
- Measurement validation ensures non-zero values unless in dark conditions. Only channel 0 is used; other channels and light source controls are ignored.

### User Personas
- **Firmware Developers**: Need robust unit tests to facilitate development and ensure reliability.
- **QA Engineers**: Require detailed test conditions and acceptance criteria to verify system functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement
1. Develop unit tests for register read and write operations.
2. Implement tests for LED on/off functionality.
3. Validate initialization sequence and ID verification.
4. Incorporate polling and interrupt modes testing.
5. Ensure measurement validation returns expected outcomes.
6. Error handling tests for misconfiguration in polling and interrupt modes.

### Acceptance Criteria
- All tests should pass without errors.
- Tests should cover all edge cases for register operations and LED control.
- Initialization sequence must correctly identify device IDs and enable functions.
- Ensure polling mode measures correctly, and interrupts are handled according to the configured thresholds.
- Measurements should return non-zero values under normal conditions.
- Polling mode must ignore interrupts; interrupt mode must correctly handle threshold trips.

### Test Conditions
- Simulate I²C communication scenarios.
- Validate LED states under different command sequences.
- Ensure device and driver initialization follow specified sequences.
- In polling mode, ensure measurements are taken every five seconds, LED behavior is verified, and interrupt registers are unset.
- In interrupt mode, confirm interrupt capabilities by setting thresholds, verifying triggers, and conducting negative tests.
- Validate that measurements return non-zero values unless in genuine dark conditions.
- Confirm correct sequence of operations: IDs before LED, thresholds before interrupts.

## User Experience

### User Interface Design
- Command-line interface for running tests.

### User Flows
1. Execute tests for all register operations.
2. Verify LED operations through test cases.
3. Run initialization and ID verification tests sequentially.
4. Test polling and interrupt modes with specified behaviors.
5. Validate measurement outputs.
6. Verify error handling and misconfiguration scenarios.

### Accessibility Requirements
- Ensure that all outputs are readable by screen readers.

## Implementation

### Development Phases
1. Define test cases.
2. Implement and validate tests.
3. Document test results.

### Dependencies
- Existing driver code must be up to date.
- Testing framework setup.

### Timeline & Milestones
- Phase 1: Test Case Definition - 2 weeks.
- Phase 2: Test Implementation - 3 weeks.
- Phase 3: Testing & Documentation - 1 week.

### Success Metrics

- Successful identification of system issues through testing.
- Confirmation of correct initialization and ID verification.

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- Potential issues with test framework integration.

### Market Risks
- Delays in implementation could impact testing timelines for upcoming releases.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Conduct a preliminary framework integration test.
- Regular progress reviews to ensure timelines are met.
