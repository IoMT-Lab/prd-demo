### Unit Tests

The file `generated_unit_tests.c` is the file created by the PRD bot when given a description of the PulsePatch problem and the existing codebase. 
It can be, with minor modification, dropped into the test harness used for the hardware-in-the-loop APR evaluation.
They are similar to the unit tests that were created by hand for the APR evaluation.
